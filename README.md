# Space Invaders  

## Rules
Basic gameplay: 
The player controls the ship at the bottom of the screen, which can move only horizontally. The enemy's ship moves both horizontally and vertically (approaching the player's ship). The player's ship can be controlled to shoot laser to destroy the enemies' ships, while the enemies' ships will randomly shoot towards the player's ship.
